**Instructions**  
1. Run the whole notebook  and read the descriptions
2. Create new Maze objects of any h x w  
3. Have patience near the end as the loops can take a while to generate many mazes then time the algo performance  
5. If the plot style misbehaves, re_run the cell with the def plot_route to reset the style to default
